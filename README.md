Choose what to run in main.py.


Choose an instance name. If you enter a number, a random instance will be generated with that seed (instance settings can be changed in main.py).


Choose a method. Options are 'read' (load an existing solution), 'solve' (solve the exact model) and 'heuristic'. If the heuristic is used as method, it will use the heuristic settings provided in main.py.


Finally, choose which log functions to run at the bottom of main.py. Options for this can be found in the Problem class.
